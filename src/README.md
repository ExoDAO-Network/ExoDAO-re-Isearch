This directory contains the engine core for re-Isearch. It contains the registry for doctypes, datatypes, indexing and search classes and methods. It also contains a collection of utility classes for things such as lists, strings, etc. These are quite similar to those in std::. The STRING class is a massive superset of the functionality.
