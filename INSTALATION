The basic steps are:

1) clone the repository.
   $ git clone https://github.com/re-Isearch/re-Isearch.git
2) Go into the build/ directory
   $ cd re-Isearch/build/

   if you have g++/gcc-10 installed and are running Ubuntu x86 64-bit you could just type Make and it should just build. 

But generally:
3) Edit the Makefile to confirm that the correct version of GCC is specified as well as the desired paths and command line args.
   The standard build is using g++/gcc-10 
   You may also use whatever gcc/g++ is installed but since we have typically multiple g++/gcc versions (due to some software requirements) you set it here.

   In the file you will see there are also provisions for other compilers such as the typical CC and cc.

   One sets here a number of compile options and flags for producing debug or production among other things.

   After the ############### End Differences ###################################### 
   there are a few options that may need tweaking on different platforms.

   $make -j4
   (or any -j option depending upon hardware)

4) To build the optional plugins
   $ make plugins


To make language bindings:
   $ cd ../swig



Windows Platform note:
   We don't officilly support the Windows platform at this time.
   That said, everything is there for Windows but have not maintained any testing so may have broken something at one point-- fortunately it should be releative easy to patch is needed and would welcome the contribution.
