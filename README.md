This is the respositiory for re-Isearch.

Project re-isearch: a novel multimodal search and retrieval engine using mathematical models and algorithms different from the all-too-common inverted index (popularized by Salton in the 1960s). The design allows it to have, in practice, effectively no limits on the frequency of words, term length, number of fields or complexity of structured data and support even overlap--- where fields or structures cross other's boundaries (common examples are quotes, line/sentences, biblical verse, annotations). Its model enables a completely flexible unit of retrieval and modes of search.

Featues/Uses

    • Low-code ETL / "Any-to-Any" architecture
    • Handles a wide range of document formats (from Atom to XML) including “live” data.
    • Powerful Search (Structure, Objects, Spatial) / Relevancy Engine
    • NoSQL Datastore
    • Useful for Analytics
    • Useful for Recommendation / Autosuggestion 
    • Embeddable in products (comparatively low resource  demands)
    • Customization. 
    • Support Peer-to-Peer and Federated architectures.
    • Freely available under a permissive software license. 


Initial project outcome: a freely available and completely open-source (and multiplatform) C++ library, bindings for other languages (such as Python) and some reference sample code using the library in some of these languages.

Under doc/ one can see the native doctypes supported.


In the directory bin/ and lib/ are binaries of standalone tools compiled on Ubuntu 18.04.2 LTS and targetting Intel Skylake or newer processors. They are included solely to enable fast software evaluations.
