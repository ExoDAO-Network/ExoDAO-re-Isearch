"<em>Since it is very difficult even for experts to evaluate search engines, search engine bias is particularly insidious.</em>"

<p>"<em>Currently, the predominant business model for commercial search engines is advertising. The goals of the advertising business model do not always correspond to providing quality search to users... we expect that advertising funded search engines will be inherently biased towards the advertisers and away from the needs of the consumers... Furthermore, advertising income often provides an incentive to provide poor quality search results.</em>"&mdash; <A HREF="http://infolab.stanford.edu/~backrub/google.html">Sergey Brin and Lawrence Page (1998)</A></p>
