The basic steps to make language bindings:
   $ cd ../swig

Here there is a main make file and it calls the Makefile.<lang> file, e.g. Makeifle.py for Python.

Its main configuraton are to
  - select the compiler (we use g++ by default)
  - specify the needed libraries on the platform (the standard values should be suitable for most Linux distros)

We also specify the version. For Python we've selected 2.7 by default but 2.6 or 3.7 or .. should all be fine.

Windows Platform note:
   We don't support the Windows platform at this time but if the core engine works we expect the bindings to work as well with mininimal effort.
