Idelete -- Program to delete files from the index.
Usage: Idelete [options] file ...
  -d (X)      // Use (X) as the root name for database files.
  -o (X)      // Document type specific option.
  -sub (X)    // Default=".wastebasket"
  -pre (X)]   // Prepend base to path (default="")
  -quiet      // Quiet
  -f [(X)|-]  // Read list from a file (X) or - for stdin
  -mark       // Just mark as Deleted and don't move or remove
              // like Iutil -del but by file name and not by key.
  -shredder   // WARNING: Dangerous option!!
              // Don't move things to wastebasket but REMOVE/DELETE!
              // WARNING: THIS REMOVES AND DESTROYS THE SOURCE!!!!!!!
  -debug      // debug...

Example: ../bin/Idelete -d DATABASE foo
  // this marks the records in foo as deleted and moves
  // path/foo to path/.wastebasket/foo.

Note: In the datebase.ini [Idelete] .wasterbasket= and .prepend= 
override the command line arguments!
